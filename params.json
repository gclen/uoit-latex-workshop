Itâ€™s a browser-based editor which makes it really simple to write and share LaTeX code. We recommend that you use this too, at least for this workshop. Feel free to use your own software if you prefer, but keep in mind that all of our examples and instructions will be based on Overleaf. If you do choose to use Overleaf, please make a free account ahead of time so that we can get started right away.\r\n\r\nWe will be covering the following basic topics:\r\n\r\n-Adding figures   \r\n-Making lists    \r\n-Math mode    \r\n-Creating tables    \r\n-Title pages    \r\n-Making a table of contents\r\n\r\nThe workshop will continue to build on one document but standalone examples can be found in the Examples folder. To get these files you can download the zipfile (or tarball if you are running Linux) that is linked on the top of this page. Alternatively you can clone the repository by running the command \r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/gclen/uoit-latex-workshop\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
